## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

With this project I improved my JS skills. The newest things I learnt are:

- How to generate a random number and floor it to eliminate the decimal part with Math.floor() and Math.random() methods

```js
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 13) + 1;
```

- How to add new items to the end of an array usign push() method

```js
cards.push(card);
```

### Continued development

I'd like to:

- ~~Hide buttons when you can't click on the them~~
- ~~Remove $20 to player's chips everytime he starts a new game~~
- ~~Add triple the bet to player's chips everytime he wins with Blackjack~~
